# GPT-Play
## This is a jupyter notebook I made in VSCode to try out some OpenAI tools - presently just GPT-4 and DALL-E

To use it, you'll need:
- A paid account with OpenAI so you can get an API key - https://openai.com/pricing
- Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
- The Jupyter Notebooks extension - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks
